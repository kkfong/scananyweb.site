# scananyweb.site

Live version on https://scananyweb.site

As someone who helps people mananging their webservers and websites for some extra cash, I decided to build a Webinterface for some tools I often use as alaways SSH-ing into my Server got annoying. You can pretty much use this with any Shell programm on linux. 

My Box is currently running on Debian8. 

You obviously need to install the included tools first and change the ToS and the Contacs etc. by yourself. 

Only index.html and the scan.php are included. Create he rest for yourself.
